1. Ask the user to enter a positive integer `n`.
2. Use a `for` loop to print all numbers from `1` to `n` on separate lines.
3. Use a `while` loop to calculate the sum of all numbers from `1` to `n` and print the result.

2)Write a Python program that includes a user-defined function to perform the following tasks:

1. Define a function named calculate_square that takes a single argument `n` and returns the square of `n`.
